"Bitwise inversion on boolean types, ``~True`` or ``~False`` has been "
"deprecated since Python 3.12, as it produces surprising and unintuitive "
"results (``-2`` and ``-1``). Use ``not x`` instead for the logical negation "
"of a Boolean. In the rare case that you need the bitwise inversion of the "
"underlying integer, convert to ``int`` explicitly (``~int(x)``)."
