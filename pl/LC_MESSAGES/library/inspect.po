"The :mod:`inspect` module provides several useful functions to help get "
"information about live objects such as modules, classes, methods, functions, "
"tracebacks, frame objects, and code objects.  For example, it can help you "

"extract and format the argument list for a function, or get all the "
"information you need to display a detailed traceback."
