"This module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads "
"(also called :dfn:`light-weight processes` or :dfn:`tasks`) --- multiple "
"threads of control sharing their global data space.  For synchronization, "
"simple locks (also called :dfn:`mutexes` or :dfn:`binary semaphores`) are "
"provided. The :mod:`threading` module provides an easier to use and higher-"
"level threading API built on top of this module."

"Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads.  The optional "

"integer value of at least 32,768 (32 KiB). If *size* is not specified, 0 is "
"used.  If changing the thread stack size is unsupported, a "
":exc:`RuntimeError` is raised.  If the specified stack size is invalid, a "
":exc:`ValueError` is raised and the stack size is unmodified.  32 KiB is "
"currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee sufficient "
"stack space for the interpreter itself.  Note that some platforms may have "
"particular restrictions on values for the stack size, such as requiring a "
"minimum stack size > 32 KiB or requiring allocation in multiples of the "
"system memory page size - platform documentation should be referred to for "
"more information (4 KiB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the "
"stack size is the suggested approach in the absence of more specific "
