"The functions below make it possible for an extension to fire monitoring "
"events as it emulates the execution of Python code. Each of these "
"functions accepts a ``PyMonitoringState`` struct which contains concise "
"information about the activation state of events, as well as the event "
"arguments, which include a ``PyObject*`` representing the code object, "
"the instruction offset and sometimes additional, event-specific arguments"
" (see :mod:`sys.monitoring` for details about the signatures of the "
"different event callbacks). The ``codelike`` argument should be an "
"instance of :class:`types.CodeType` or of a type that emulates it."
