"Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language."
"  It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level "
"dynamic data types, and classes.  Python combines remarkable power with very"
" clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well"
" as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++.  It is also "
"usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable "
"interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on "
"the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later."
